# TEST FILES

Basically, this is my first ever pygame project. I needed some help learning how to use it. So, I ran a few basic test games to emulate movement on the board.

* Monopoly Text Based Game

So, I have already made a multiplayer monopoly-based game called "Syndicate" when I was in 10th grade. [https://github.com/pranay-venkatesh/Syndicate]. So, the Monopoly text-based game is just a translation to python. It's a very simple monopoly game. Rather than having Chance and that Fortune Chest stuff, there are four squares that either give or take money. Otherwise, the same as Monopoly. It's Star Wars themed, because why not.

* Move the peg around

Another very simple thing. It's a basic pygame test where you can move a small peg around a rectangular path, by pressing enter. Nothing fancy.

* Row-based movement

Here, we have the full monopoly board and we let two players jump around the whole board. I had to create a proper button system to make this work properly.
