# Monopoly

Two player monopoly game. Eventually looking to make a bot or AI play.

This is based off of an original text-based Monopoly sort of game I made in Grade 10 in Java. See here - [https://github.com/pranay-venkatesh/Syndicate]

* Two Player Game

So, very simple stuff. Two pegs : one red and one blue move about a board and buy places using buttons. Nothing impressive, I know. But it's my first project on PyGame. I've only made text-based projects thus far so this is a big step up for me (especially before I had to muck about for like 10 days before I got the hang of Pygame).
